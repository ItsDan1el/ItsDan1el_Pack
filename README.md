# Resourcepack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Readme:

Hello, I'm ItsDaniel, thanks for using my resourcepack. Here are some reminders for using the pack.

1.Optifine is required. [Download Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads)

2.This pack contains custom models

3.I will keep updating

4.My totem of undying has its texture defaulted to ItsDan1el's skin. To change it, just rename or replace the original file to your own skin. Remember to change the name of 
the file.

5.This pack is made for Minecraft Java 1.16, using other version might make the texture buggy.

6.This pack is a modified version of the Aeroteam's pack so credits to them.

7.File will not be uploaded to github because of the 1000file limit.

8.Zip file might not work, unzip the file if it doesn't work.
